# ARC-AGI Agent Architecture (§5.3)

**Paper claim.** Using Gemini 3 Flash as both proposer and underlying agent model, optany evolves a naive 10-line agent seed (one LLM call) into a 300+ line, 4-component architecture with fallbacks. Test accuracy rises **32.5% → 89.5%** (+57pp); validation reaches 93.5%.

## Code (this folder)

- `main.py`, `utils.py` — runnable optany pipeline (copied from `examples/arc_agi/`).

## Reproduction

`main.py` is wired to use `./logs/` as the GEPA run directory. Because the bundled `logs/gepa_state.bin` already exists, GEPA will load that checkpoint and resume from the paper run rather than starting from scratch — letting reviewers verify the optimized agent immediately.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-key>
uv run python main.py            # resumes from bundled state
```

To run a fresh optimization instead, delete (or move) `logs/gepa_state.bin` first.
